This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Project File Structure
This codebase follows the Next.js App Router architecture, organizing components and pages efficiently for scalability and clarity.

App Router Structure: The project utilizes the Next.js App Router, meaning that each page is contained within its own directory under the app folder.

Component Organization: Components are located at the root (./) directory to ensure easy access and reuse throughout the project.

Page Directories: Each page is organized in a specific directory under the app folder. For instance, the page for "Schools in Ireland" can be found in the following path:

### /app/ireland/page.tsx
This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and easier to maintain.
